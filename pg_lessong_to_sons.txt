Something I taught 15 yo: People are quite willing to admit they're wrong about math, but less willing to as the subjects get softer. And since being right is such an advantage, it's worth stretching the attitude you have toward math as far softward as you can.
 
 
18 Apr 2024
Something I taught 15 yo: If it's not obvious how to solve a math problem, it often works to ask what you *can* calculate or prove from what you're given. These intermediate results will often suggest the path to the answer.
 
 
12 Apr 2024
Something I taught 15 yo: In everyday life, big decisions often occur mixed together with small ones. If you're not careful you'll tend to give them equal weight. So separate decisions as much as you can. There are many techniques for doing this.
 
 
29 Mar 2024
Something I taught 11 yo: using "said" in dialogue is like framing works on paper with plain white mats. It's the right choice nearly all the time. You want people to notice the dialogue/art itself, not the mat.
 
 
26 Feb 2024
Something I taught 15 yo: When a process is corrupt you're proportionately entitled to hack it. Indeed, it's often the only way to make it interesting.
 
 
21 Feb 2024
Something I taught 11 yo: The less competent the judges in a contest, the less it matters to win it.
 
 
17 Feb 2024
Something I taught 11 yo: There's a double connection between political correctness and humor. If you have to be politically correct, there are a lot of jokes you can't tell. And politically correct people are usually humorless by nature.
 
 
31 Jan 2024
Something I taught 11 yo: You can use quicker, riskier techniques for checking answers than for generating them, because to tell you that a wrong answer was right, your check would have to reproduce exactly the same error.
 
 
28 Jan 2024
Something I taught 11 yo: When you learn a new word, as long as it's not merely a fancy synonym of a word you already know, you usually also get to learn a new idea.
 
 
11 Jan 2024
Had an interesting conversation with 11 yo when he said he worried a lot about his schoolwork. I told him the ambitious always have some worry, but you can't let yourself be consumed by it. Even if all you cared about was work, you do better work when you're happy.
 
 
23 Nov 2023
Explained to 11 yo that the Holy Ghost is not a ghost in the Halloween sense.
 
Also taught him about the concept of design by committee, and the constant trouble caused in European history by the doctrine of the Trinity.
 
 
3 Dec 2023
Taught 11 yo about the concept of "young adult fiction" and that he should just skip it and go straight to books written for adults.
 
 
30 Oct 2023
Something I taught 14 yo: People tend to underestimate how much things can change, and this causes them to undervalue ideas that aren't viable now but could be in the future.
 
 
 
14 Sep 2023
Something I taught 11 yo: When something has no prestige, the people who like it are more likely to have honest motives.
 
 
15 Aug 2023
11 yo asked what I'd say if I could broadcast a message to everyone on Earth. I told him I'd tell them whatever Noora Health teaches new mothers about taking care of their babies after they come home from the hospital.
 
 
10 Aug 2023
Something I taught 11 yo: If you want to eat healthily, one easy rule of thumb is not to eat things with brand names.
 
 
29 Jul 2023
Something I told 11 yo: if you want to be on a poster that college students put up on their walls, it helps to die young, so there are no pictures of you old. James Dean, Jim Morrison, Che Guevara, Marilyn Monroe, Bob Marley, Bruce Lee.
 
 
12 Jul 2023
14 yo and 11 yo showed up at my office door asking for startup advice. I told them that the way to get really rich was to get good at programming now and start the startup in a few years, when knowing how to program had started to make good ideas visible.
 
 
17 Mar 2023
I told a friend's 15 yo old son that outside of Europe, people don't have to dismiss a cookie warning before they can view a web site, and at first he didn't believe me.
 
 
7 Mar 2023
Jessica let 10 yo stay home sick from school today. I told him that once we'd decided, we weren't going to change our minds, so he was free to enjoy himself instead of having to look sad and sick.
 
  
 
27 Jan 2023
On the way to school, 10 yo asked "What if I'm a failure?" I told him that at least some of his projects would probably fail, and that if they didn't, it would mean he was being too conservative.
 
 
31 Dec 2022
Something I told 13 yo: to read "well enough" is to read like an adult can walk — i.e. under ordinary circumstances, near perfectly.
 
 
8 Dec 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: The fear that you won't get something sometimes makes you lie to yourself about whether you want it. To counteract this, ask yourself: If I already had it, would I be glad?
 
 
1 Dec 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: Addiction is where you go from something taking you from normal to good to it taking you from bad to normal.
 
 
15 Nov 2022
10 yo told me this morning that he didn't know how to do long division. He was out sick the day they learned it. He wants me to teach him. I realized I haven't done it since school myself. I wasn't even sure I was remembering the algorithm right, though fortunately I seem to be.
 
 
31 Oct 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: In primary school it's sufficient to try really hard, because they never give you problems too hard for a moderately intelligent kid to solve with sufficient effort. But as you get older this gradually stops being the case.
 
 
17 Oct 2022
10 yo asked how I know so much. I told him curiosity x time.
 
 
17 Oct 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: Some of the patterns in the numbers are intrinsic (e.g. the alternation of even and odd) and others are artifacts of our use of base 10 (e.g. multiplying by 10 is trivial), but both enable shortcuts in calculation.
 
 
14 Oct 2022
Something I told 13 yo: Controversy is artificial interestingness.
 
 
13 Oct 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: You can sometimes learn as much from things done badly as things done well. Sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing.
 
 
11 Oct 2022
Something I explained to 10 yo: Math questions on standardized tests are often meant to test whether you understand math at a deeper level than just grinding through some procedure you've been taught. So when you get what looks like a hard question, first look for shortcuts.
 
 
28 Sep 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: Higher energy prices make almost everything more expensive, because almost everything takes energy to make.
 
 
15 Sep 2022
Something I told 10 yo: Saying you've created a test that no one can study for because it's a test of natural ability is like saying you've written a piece of software that can't be hacked. Except people who write software are smart enough never to believe that.
 

20 Jun 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: Supply and demand causes jobs people like to be low paid. So the only way to get paid a lot to do something you like is to be able to do something few other people can.
 
 
17 Jun 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: There are some people who want to be told what to do. They find the certainty of it reassuring.
 
 
8 Jun 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: The easier a test is, the more getting the best score depends on extrinsic things like checking your answers to make sure you didn't make stupid mistakes.
 
 
7 Jun 2022
Taught 10 yo about the concept of the midwit peak, and how the critical factor in making ideas appealing to midwits is that they have a little nugget of clever-seeming knowledge in them. E.g. that airfoil shapes are what generates lift.
 
 
19 May 2022
Something I taught 10 yo: Instead of competing with everyone else for the attention of the median person, it's often worthwhile to make something just for smart people. They may be a small fraction of the population, but there are still a lot of them in total.
 
 
17 May 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: There are people who are "bad" in the sense of breaking the rules, but who are actually really nice. And there are others who obey all the rules and yet are really nasty. Sometimes the nastiest not only obey the rules, but enforce them.
 
 
18 Apr 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: The point of practice is to cause you to do the right thing by habit, without having to think about it consciously. That's why it's worthwhile practicing things you "already know" how to do.
 
 
12 Apr 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: It's a polite fiction that all university departments are equivalent. In fact the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely.

 
4 Apr 2022
Something I taught 9 yo: Some kinds of work are more interruptible than others. If you do one of the less interruptible kinds, you have to arrange your life to make it hard to interrupt. This will be difficult, and will make you seem eccentric to most people.
 
 
23 Mar 2022
Something I taught 9 yo: We may not realize till much later what was the biggest thing that happened today.
 
 
12 Mar 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: One advantage companies that are still run by their founders have over other companies is that founders have the confidence to be unconventional. Employees worry they'll get in trouble if they do things differently. Founders don't.
 
 
11 Mar 2022
Something I told 13 yo: Even if Russia pulled out of Ukraine tomorrow, they'd still be very damaged. It has taken decades for western governments and companies to learn to trust Russia. They won't again so long as Putin is still in power.
 
 
2 Mar 2022
Something I taught 9 yo: One advantage of working on projects of your own is that you never have to be bored. If you're stuck waiting somewhere with nothing to do, you can think about new things you want to do on the project.
 
 
1 Mar 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: Making important decisions without consulting anyone else is not a sign of strength or intelligence. In fact rather the opposite.
 
 
26 Feb 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: Occupiers generally end up committing atrocities. Resistance fighters kill occupying soldiers and then vanish. Unable to reach them, the occupiers kill people they can reach, who are often noncombatants.
 

23 Feb 2022
Something I taught 9 yo: Even if the stuff you're learning in your classes is just mindless memorization, it's still worth getting good grades, because good grades get you sorted with smarter people, and being around smart people is genuinely worthwhile.

 
31 Jan 2022
Something I taught 13 yo: The problem with dictatorships is that they're dictators all the way down, and the ones at the bottom are some of the worst.

 
16 Jan 2022
Something I told 9 yo: It's actually a good sign that people get so upset about small things nowadays, because it's a sign that there are fewer big things wrong.
 

2 Jan 2022
Something I taught 12 yo: a selfish player is a weaker player, because he's more predictable. If I know an opposing player won't pass the ball, I only have to guard against the dribble. If he might, I have to guard against both, which puts me in a weaker position if he dribbles.

 
 
13 Dec 2021
Something I taught 12 yo: The old can compensate for their slowness by having better judgement about when to expend energy. This is very visible in sports, but it happens in many other kinds of work too.

 
25 Nov 2021
Something I taught 9 yo on the way to school: The unusual thing about Nintendo is that they're good at both hardware and stories. It's very rare for a company to be good at two such different things, but powerful if you can pull it off.

 
22 Nov 2021
Something I taught 9 yo: Accentual meter is the natural meter for English, used in everything from Beowulf to Dr. Seuss.
 
 
15 Nov 2021
Something I taught 12 yo: Socialism and dictatorship fit together like two jigsaw puzzle pieces, because in practice communal ownership = state control.
 

9 Nov 2021
On the way to school taught 12 yo about how to hack tests by e.g. predicting the questions you'll be asked. But I also taught him that this is a technique whose utility diminishes as you get older and are able to escape from systems that use broken tests.

 
28 Oct 2021
Something I taught 12 yo: the probability of being able to "beat the system" increases when the system is inconsistent or corrupt.

 
21 Oct 2021
Something I taught 12 yo: The difference between a random fact and (for lack of a better word) a non-random one is how many other facts it's connected to. The latter kind are better.
 
 
23 Sep 2021
Something I taught 12 yo: Pushing kids only works up till about the age of 18. If you want to do great things as an adult, you have to be able to push yourself. And if parents push kids too much, they may inhibit them from learning how to do this.

 
21 Sep 2021
Something 9 yo taught me (by example): if you enjoy life a lot, you make everyone around you enjoy life too.

26 Jun 2021
Told 9 yo all the cheesy modifications a Hollywood studio would make to his latest story if they made it into a movie. He was so amused he begged me to tell him more.

 
6 Jun 2021
Something I taught my 12 yo: There may be some kinds of work where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but in the great majority it's an advantage to be idealistic and optimistic, even if that means risking looking like a fool sometimes.
 
 
30 May 2021
Something I taught 9 yo: If you're a writer, you'll always have something interesting to do even when you're stuck somewhere boring, like waiting in line. You can think of what you're going to write next.

 
29 May 2021
Something I taught 9 yo: Foolish people laugh a lot, medium wise people are solemn and serious, and very wise people laugh a lot.
 

8 May 2021
Something I told 9 yo: Most people think that how happy they are depends on what happens to them, but actually if the same things happened to two people, one could be much happier than the other.
 
 
29 Apr 2021
"He deserves to be more famous."
 
 — 9 yo after I told him what Trevor Blackwell did

 
25 Apr 2021
Something I told 9 yo: If you're a maker, resist being told what to do by people who aren't.
 

8 Apr 2021
Something I taught my 12 yo: Most people underestimate how much the world can change, and practically no one can predict where the change will happen. The only thing you can predict for sure is that some very surprising things will happen.
 

19 Mar 2021
8 yo says he wants to write stories when he grows up, but he also wants to do something to help people. I told him stories do help people, and that for kids in particular books are often a lifeline.
 

12 Mar 2021
Something I told 12 yo and 8 yo on the way home from school: You can put your energy into being good at stuff or seeming cool, but not both. Any energy that goes into seeming cool comes out of being good.

 
2 Mar 2021
Taught 8 yo a rule of thumb for avoiding cults and cult-like things: Avoid groups that tell you not to talk to your family.

 
13 Jan 2021
Told skeptical 11 yo how much I like having kids, even though I'd never have expected to either when I was 11.
 
 
10 Oct 2020
Something I taught my 8 yo: The best things made for kids also include things invisible to kids that are amusing to parents. 

 
3 Oct 2020
Something I taught 11 yo: Cheering yourself up is among the things that parents do for little kids, but that you have to learn how to do for yourself as you grow up. 
 
Techniques: exercise, trying something slightly (but not too) ambitious, helping someone else.
 

30 Sep 2020
Something I taught my 11 yo: Sociopaths have an advantage in the short term because they're not constrained by shame, but once people realize what they are, it starts to work against them.
 
 
21 Sep 2020
11 yo asked why he had to learn spellings. I told him honestly that although spelling may not really matter, if he couldn't spell, people would think he was stupid. And that was sufficiently motivating.
 

15 Jun 2020
Told 8 yo that in a few years he may start to be embarrassed when I tell him I love him, but not to worry because when he gets to be about 22 he'll start to like it again. 
 
Also told him that since he's so grown up, I'm going to start treating him like he's 22 in this respect.
 
 
2 Jun 2020
Something I taught my 11 yo: If you're asked a question in school, on a test for example, that's a clue about how to solve it. It means it can be solved using techniques you already know. This is a difference between school and the real world.
 
 
14 May 2020
Something I told my 8 yo: If you do creative work, try to avoid situations where people with less ability than you can tell you what to do, or edit your work.
 
 
25 Apr 2020
11 yo and his friends are always coming up with ideas for beating the system. I told him that the really big money is not in little tricks like that, but in making things that help people.
 
 
20 Apr 2020
Something I taught my 11 yo: Practice teaches you how to do things without having to think consciously about each step. So even when you "already know how" to do something by making a conscious effort, you can often reach another level of knowing how to do it through practice.
 
 
7 Apr 2020
"Someone should write a program to do this crap."
 
— 11 yo, tiring of Basic's verbosity, proposes the IDE
 
(I told him there are programs that do it, but the real solution is just to use a better language.)
 
 
2 Apr 2020
Something I taught my 11 yo today: Some amount of programming consists of copying and pasting lines you've already written, and then changing a few parameters. But the better the language, the less of this you do.
  

21 Mar 2020
Something I told my 11 yo recently: The apparently random collection of things you learn when you're young makes you into a sort of key. Then you have to find the lock it matches. But that's not as hard as it sounds, because the matching lock is usually nearby.
 
 
31 Dec 2019
Something I taught my 7 yo yesterday: When someone loves someone else, it doesn't just make the loved person happy. It also makes you happy to love someone.
 
 
26 Dec 2019
Something I taught my 10 yo: If you're naturally competitive, instead of spreading a thin layer of it across all of life, pile it up in a few specific areas and just relax in the rest.
 
 
6 Dec 2019
Something I taught my 7 yo on the way to school: Don't underestimate how many people you can help. One person can help thousands of other people.


29 Nov 2019
@Paulg: 
Explained to 7 yo that the phrase for what he is right now is "Star Wars scholar." I explained that lots of people are this way about other things. E.g. there tehre are lots of Shakespeare scholars. He found it encouraging that the phenomenon had a name. 
->
@Paulg: 
I told 7 yo that Shakespeare's plays were in fact the Star Wars of their time. I expected him to be electrified by this daring claim, but found he already took it for granted. 
->
@JeffLonsdale:
Sounds like you have done a good job innoculating him against the "serious adults work on boring stuff" idea that many kids develop.
->
@Paulg: 
That's one of the things I try hardest to teach them. If I could only lodge that and 5 or so similair ideas deeply enough into their heads, I would be satisfied. 

 
18 Nov 2019
10 yo asked what age kids are the most difficult for parents. Told him newborns are the most overall load, but teenagers cause the highest spikes, because they have the highest ratio of power to judgment.
 

8 Jul 2019
Something I taught my 10 yo son and his friend today:
 
The way most people who are really good at something got so good at it was by (a) caring a lot about it and (b) practicing a lot.

 
23 Apr 2019
Looking at my 7 yo, I asked myself if there was anything that had been consistent about my life from when I was 7 til now.
 
Instantly the answer popped into my head: being told "How dare you say that!" by the prim and conventional-minded.
 

3 Nov 2018
A simple rule I taught my 9 yo today: If you can't figure something out, figure out how to figure it out.

 
24 Sep 2017
5 yo asked what meretricious meant. I told him it was like when bad people pretend to be good, but for things instead of people.


9 Apr 2017

@paulg: 
4yo: I know the biggest number.

Me: What?

8yo: What about the 160 billion and one?

4yo: Oh yeah, it's that.
->
@carvak: 
What would you do if it were "I know the biggest prime number"
->
@paulg: 
We're ok. I taught the 8 yo that proof a couple weeks ago.
 

8 Apr 2017
Taught 8 yo about the rapid growth of 2^x by explaining how croissants are made.
 

6 Apr 2017
Taught 8 yo about F = ma by showing how a soccer player could run faster if he lost weight. That really brought it home.

 
16 Mar 2017
4 yo: God isn't real.
 
Me: You figured that out?
 
4 yo: I told Tom.
 
Me: You shouldn't tell other kids.
 
4 yo: But I want them to be smart.
 
 
20 Jan 2017
7 yo told 4 yo there's no Santa. 4 yo asked me if it's true. I asked what he thought. He said it can't be, because that would be sad.
 
 
18 Nov 2016
@paulg: Taught 4 yo the concept of telling a story convincingly. It was if as he'd been waiting for that idea.
->
@DanielApt: 
I'm curious. What lessons did you share?
->
@paulg:
Having your affect match the story, producing the sort of details you'd know if the story had actually happened.

9 Nov 2016
I told my 7 yo Hillary lost because she was less charismatic. That's not a sanitized version; it's happened in every election since 1968.
 

11 Aug 2016
"I only want a little space station."
 
– incredulous 7 yo after I told him it would probably take him till his twenties to build one

 
10 Jul 2016
7 yo asked me to explain what elegance was. Told him it was the sort of beauty that comes from simplicity.


29 May 2016
Teaching my 7 yo math has also shown me how many things they never taught me. It was all plug and chug.

 
15 Nov 2015
There are two kinds of bad, naughty bad and mean bad. Naughty bad is not as bad as mean bad.
 
– something I taught my 3 yo today


23 Oct 2015
Explained taxes and spending to 6 yo. He suggested printing money. Told him prices adjust. He was consoled Roman emperors made same mistake.
 
 
14 Sep 2015
"I don't want to be a starfish! Starfishes don't have eyes! I hate that!"
 
– 3 yo rejecting proposed role in story told by 6 yo
 
 
26 Jul 2015
6 yo: "Can you tell me a story? You haven't told me a story for 22 hours."
 
 
11 Jun 2015
My 6 yo asked what programming was like. I told him it was like making Lego out of words.
